This is where I created my [blog](https://jamesl88.github.io).

As a junior web developer I tend to come across all types of challenges and problems I need to solve or learn to do by myself.
Google and stackoverflow has been very useful but there are times where information is all over the place and so this blog is created for my own personal use as well as a way to reflect on problems and tutorials I've come across.

The posts that will be made for this blog will probably be the type of post I think I'll use to look back on for future reference.
