This is where I created my [blog](https://jamesl88.github.io).

As a junior web developer I tend to come across all types of challenges and problems I need to solve or learn to do by myself.
Google and stackoverflow has been very helpful but there are times when information is all over the place and can be very difficult to find.Therefore this blog is created for my own personal use as well as a way to reflect on problems and tutorials I've come across.

The posts that will be made for this blog will probably be the kind of posts I'll use for future references.
