			<p>You may have noticed that there is a hiatus in blog posts between 2016 and 2019</p>

<p>To be honest, I basically forgot about the blog really. It wasn’t on my list of priorities, and I guess I initially started the blog to help with my
chances for job opportunities. Being a junior at the time, it was tough to brake into a role without some experience under your belt.</p>

<p>Also I didn’t really have any topics to blog about. Initially the blog was supposed to only have programming related topics, but my stance on that has changed now,
I’ll blog about anything that I find interesting to write about from now on.</p>

<p>I had to restore my blog a little by updating the Ruby Gems this blog was using. Once that was all done, it was rather easy to start creating posts. Jekyll is an amazing tool for this
and I’m glad I was able to create content immediately because of it.</p>

<p>The reason I’ve started blogging again was due to watching a Youtube video about how to be successful or something similar, the content creator gave his top X tips
and one of the things he recommends was to write in a journal or blog. Writing regularly will likely improve my communication skills. It’s also really fun to read
back on something I’ve written after a long while and compare it to my current way of thinking today. I actually started a programming journal but that has some really personal experiences with programming and
I often forget to fill it in or have any content for it.</p>

<p>So much has changed since my last blog post (before the hiatus in 2016) and my experience as a developer has grown quite a bit. My career path has switched between technology stacks quite a few times as well.
I’m also reading more personal development books and I’m thinking of writing reviews on the ones that have an impact on my life. Sharing this knowledge also helps me
develop myself further as well by becoming better at articulating something as well as testing to see if I truly understand what topic I’m writing about. I’m also not expecting
anyone to read this blog either, this is really for personal use.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how long I’d be able to maintain or add new content to the blog, but I’ll take on the challenge nonetheless.</p>
