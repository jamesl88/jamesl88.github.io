And so I thought it would be a great time to write a post on the subject and hopefully reflect on what went well, what went less well and learn from hindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-years-ago&quot;&gt;7 Years ago…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started in early 2013, my previous employer David Kramaley had gotten in touch by email and mentioned how he remembered I was curious about programming and used to ask questions about it when working with him. He said that a Coding Bootcamp might be something I may be interested in and provided a link to one based in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wished I had the original email, I must’ve deleted it when I was cleaning up my inbox because of wanting to reach &lt;a href=&quot;/achieving-inbox-zero/&quot;&gt;“inbox zero”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I recall correctly, coincidently I had actually become more curious about programming due to hearing about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;. I had already created an account and have been doing the introduction to programming path. According to my profile, I had created the Codecademy account on &lt;strong&gt;Feb 27th 2013&lt;/strong&gt;. So the email from David would’ve been in early to mid March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked the idea of a Coding Bootcamp, learning programming for 10 weeks then being able to get at least a junior position after graduation. This was very attractive to me as I was either unemployed, or I was working a part-time job doing deliveries and/or cashier work at a Chinese take-away. Else it was working my families Fish and Chip shop with my mother. This particular Bootcamp was based in America and I wasn’t willing to relocate, so I quickly Googled for Coding Bootcamps in the UK, there I discovered Makers Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;makers-academy&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so thankful that a coding Bootcamp was based in a location I can attend. One thing I need to mention is that Makers Academy was a start-up company during this time, they had only &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; started taking students in &lt;strong&gt;February 2013&lt;/strong&gt; which was literally the previous month. Here is a link to their blog post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.makersacademy.com/we-just-turned-five-9a45da48206f&quot;&gt;We Just Turned 5&lt;/a&gt; (which should match the dates I mentioned)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cohorts were &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; small I think fewer than 8 students maybe? I don’t know exactly how many students there were at the time. But I’m guessing that this was intentional, the courses are very intensive and require a serious commitment from their students thus Makers Academy were &lt;strong&gt;very selective&lt;/strong&gt; in regards to who they allow to enrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-interview&quot;&gt;My Interview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 27th March 2013, I sent my application. I received a confirmation email and 10 minutes after this, invited to interview at Makers Academy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/becoming-a-software-developer-1.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 100px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to schedule a time using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://doodle.com&quot;&gt;Doodle&lt;/a&gt; link, which was quite nice. And in the email I was asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before arriving, please complete the first three tracks (Introduction to Ruby, Control Flow in Ruby &amp;amp; Looping with Ruby) at:  http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect, I had been casually using Codecademy anyway. Codecademy still has my old achievements and what day I completed them (which is pretty cool to look at retrospectively):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/becoming-a-software-developer-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I started the ruby track on &lt;strong&gt;April 1st 2013&lt;/strong&gt;, so I guess I wasn’t as excited as I thought about the tracks at the time. Although, it could be that the appointment I had with Makers Academy was maybe a week or two ahead which was why I didn’t start the tracks straight away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-day-of-the-interview&quot;&gt;The Day of The Interview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Its worth noting that this was 7 years ago, I may have misremembered some of this and I don’t have any of my emails to verify any of this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the day I had met with Evgeny Shadchnev - the co-founder. They asked me some basic questions about my background, why I want to do this, what my motivations were and gauge how interested in programming I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down to do a tech test. It was a very basic one that I should’ve learned through the Codecademy tracks as they requested. I can’t remember the specifics but I do remember failing to complete the (very basic) task. There was another task to do a problem solving exercise which I also failed to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember too well what happened afterwards, Evgeny either told me on the day or via email afterwards that they &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; accept me into the course! I was rejected due to my poor performance. In hindsight, I blame myself for not spending more time going through the Codecademy tracks and studying harder! It was mentioned that I can apply again once I improve on the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-interview-attempt&quot;&gt;Second Interview Attempt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had gone home dejected but I didn’t give up. I remember immediately applying again, and attending a second interview shortly  after (a week or so), and I had again failed the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that Evgeny had told this in person this time that they cannot accept me in the next cohort either because he didn’t think I was ready. If I remember correctly, he also mentioned that to ‘code’ I need to have better problem solving skills, this was arguably a skill that cannot be ‘learned’ and therefore programming was maybe not for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was devastated but this time I was able to respond to him directly, mentioning that I was very serious about this course and if he were to give me a chance, I will not take it for granted. Thankfully, Evgeny had given me this opportunity to enrol me onto the course, perhaps he saw how persistence and determined I was which helped influenced this decision. This was probably the moment that had truly kickstarted my career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a theory that my enrolling onto the course was a experiment for him to see whether someone (with poor problem solving skills) like me can truly thrive in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was to join the May 2013 cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;course-fees&quot;&gt;Course fees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, the course fees were &lt;strong&gt;£5000&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;10 weeks&lt;/strong&gt;. If you were a female then you would automatically get a discount of £500 thus costing &lt;strong&gt;£4500&lt;/strong&gt;. A bit controversial in my opinion but as a private company they’re within their rights to charge whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have the terms in my email. Here were the payment plan options available to me (in 2013):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard Payment Plan&lt;/strong&gt; – 50% in advance, 50% over six months following the course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance Payment Plan&lt;/strong&gt; – 90% in advance, 10% discount applies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deferred Payment Plan&lt;/strong&gt; – no payment due until after the course, with 20% surcharge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the standed and advance plan, the deposit is payable not later than seven days before the commencement of the course. The deposit is non-refundable if the student withdraws from the course within the seven days prior to the start of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat was that if Makers Academy hadn’t received the deposit seven days before the commencement of a course, Makers Academy may, at its option, re-allocate the place reserved for the student to a wait-listed  student in which case the original student will no longer be able to attend the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-standard-plan&quot;&gt;The Standard Plan&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deposit of 50% up-front and the remaining 50% of the course fee is payable in six equal monthly instalments with the first being due at the  end of the month following the end of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This for me seemed like a great option for those who wouldn’t normally be able to afford the fees for the course upfront. So a deposit of £2500 and then a monthly plan to pay the rest &lt;strong&gt;after the course&lt;/strong&gt;. Hopefully the student would’ve managed to secure a junior developer role and then pay back a portion of the fee with their salary each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-deferred-payment-plan&quot;&gt;The Deferred Payment Plan&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining full course fee plus a surcharge of 20% of the course fee is payable in twelve equal monthly instalments with the first being due at the end of the month following the end of the course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option was for those who can’t pay anything. There are additional terms with this one, one of which the student has to agree that if they get a role through a partner of Makers Academy, the course fee
payments may, at the option of Makers Academy, be paid directly to Makers Academy by the Partner by deduction from the salary of the student. So there are some serious caveats associated with this one, nonetheless provide another great option for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-advance-payment-plan&quot;&gt;The Advance Payment Plan&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;90% in advance and the remaining 10% discounted. This was the plan I had gone for, having no job or money of my own, I turned to my family for a loan, my sister had savings and had happily loaned me the cost of the full course, I’m still so very grateful for that. This meant that it cost me £4500 in total thanks to the discount. Even if my family couldn’t loan me the money, my girlfriend (now wife) also offered to loan me the money if I were unable get it from my family, so I’m very fortunate in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was to pay back my sister with my salary as soon as I get my first paid developer role which I did. When I secured a role I paid her back monthly instalments of £500 over 9 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;course-attendance-and-conduct&quot;&gt;Course Attendance and Conduct.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Makers Academy courses are intensive courses that require a serious commitment from all students. Makers Academy wants to ensure that all students on its courses have the best possible opportunity to succeed and therefore reserves the right to suspend from the course any student who in any way disrupts the course
environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If, despite our careful selection process, we find that a student is failing to keep up with the demands of the course they have chosen, and after consulting with the student we decide that the student is not likely to successfully complete the course, we reserve the right to require the student to leave the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it gets pretty serious here, if you cannot keep up, they can get you to leave the course though at their discretion, offer a refund for any remaining time. Makes sense, they’re taking a risk with the student and the career change of becoming a software developer requires a huge commitment and you need to hold yourself accountable if you fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is how it all started, its been 7 years since I enrolled into the May cohort. Makers Academy was a highly selective 12-week Coding Bootcamp. They probably designed their policies this way to make sure they get the most committed students and I was very determined to be one of those students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;£4500 - £5000 for 10 weeks seems like a lot (though &lt;strong&gt;during&lt;/strong&gt; my course they changed it to &lt;strong&gt;12 weeks&lt;/strong&gt;). It all comes down to what you think you’ll get out of it. If you can secure a role, you’ll very quickly make that money back. Investing in yourself never a bad idea, though it all depends on personal responsibility, how committed and determined you are, what sacrifices are you prepared to make in order to achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I actually think Evgeny was right in some ways when he told me that some problem solving skills are not ones you can ‘learn’ and so I will struggle in this industry. I still think this is true today, my problem solving skills are very poor when compared to my colleagues, but I believe that it is my determination and persistence that drives me to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is part 1 of my Becoming a Software Developer series. There is so much to write and so I need to break down this post into multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I should’ve documented my experience at Makers Academy, they actually suggested it as well. But I suppose that wasn’t something I was interested in at the time. In any case, I look forward to reflecting and thinking about the next entry in this series.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">Reflecting on how I began my programming journey.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How I build habits</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/how-i-build-habits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I build habits" /><published>2020-05-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/how-i-build-habits</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/how-i-build-habits/">&lt;p&gt;On 23rd November 2018, I finished reading a book called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23130805-the-slight-edge&quot;&gt;The Slight Edge by Jeff Olson&lt;/a&gt; (which I re-read on August 21st 2019 - both dates according to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/jameslieu&quot;&gt;Goodreads profile&lt;/a&gt;). I highly recommend the book and one major take-away for me was that &lt;strong&gt;small consistent actions compound and create big results&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember exactly when I adopted this principle into my life. But I still use it today and thought it would make for a good post. I incorporate this into my daily habits - one of which is do one set of push-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daily-push-ups-&quot;&gt;Daily Push-ups 📅&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my habit tracker, I have a daily habit of doing only &lt;strong&gt;one set of push-ups – minimum 15 reps&lt;/strong&gt;. The idea of only doing one set of 15 repetitions (instead of 3-5 sets for example), is designed to be the very &lt;strong&gt;minimum&lt;/strong&gt; I can and should achieve &lt;strong&gt;even on a bad day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, it is not uncommon for some days where you have a lot of energy. And some days where you have very little energy or are in a low mood thus less motivated i.e. a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By setting the task to an achievable goal &lt;strong&gt;on a bad day&lt;/strong&gt;, will increase the likelyhood I will action and complete the task. If the goal was set to something more difficult i.e. 50 reps - 3 sets, I would be less motivated on those days and therefore risk breaking that daily consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note that I’ve set only a &lt;strong&gt;minimum&lt;/strong&gt; number of reps not a &lt;strong&gt;maximum&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, on a bad day I’ll just do 15 reps, but on a good day (which is usually more common) I’ll do 40, and even on a great day I may end up doing 60-80 reps. Sometimes I do smaller reps but more sets. The key thing is to maintain consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system for me has worked very well, if memory serves, I started this particular task last summer meaning I’ve been doing push-ups almost every day since August 2019, there were only two days I hadn’t achieved this daily task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tricking-your-mind-&quot;&gt;Tricking your mind 😎&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also taps into another productivity trick. The reason why we procrastinate is usually because our minds just isn’t in the ‘mood’ to do a particular task or chore, so we tend to put it off by doing something else. However, if you’re able to just &lt;strong&gt;start&lt;/strong&gt; the task, your motivation to continue immediately increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-wash-dishes-example&quot;&gt;The Wash Dishes Example&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine after dinner, a pile of dishes are stacked into your sink. You had decided to do them after finishing the TV show or movie you were watching, when it finishes you walk to your kitchen and see the stack of dishes and in no mood to wash them right now, maybe you say to yourself that you’ll do it in the morning. However, If you instead say to yourself, I’ll just clean &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; plate, you might just decide “I might as well just wash them” and then proceed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply actioning the task can be enough to motivate you and you’re less likely to put it off if the task is quick and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to the push-ups example, making it an easy task by setting the minimum to &lt;strong&gt;15&lt;/strong&gt; encourages me to just get it done and over with, it only takes 10-15 seconds to do them. However, once I begin, I can quickly decide whether I can do more, often my goal of only doing 15 reps (on that particular &lt;strong&gt;bad day&lt;/strong&gt;) becomes 30-40 reps. And if not, I’ll just do a guilt-free 15 reps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;big-results&quot;&gt;Big Results&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started this habit, my initial minimum push-up repetition count was 5. I had gotten so out of shape, I was barely able to achieve 10-20 reps on a good day. Now I’m able to do up to 80+ (to failure) in a push-up set precisely because I’ve been doing them daily and so I increased the ‘minimum’ required to complete the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-examples-&quot;&gt;Other examples 💡&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I used the push-ups as an example, but the principle can be applied to any task you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My company had provided me an annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralsight.com/&quot;&gt;Pluralsight&lt;/a&gt; membership (In November 2019) so I can study at my leisure, I watched it a few times but not often at all. It wasn’t until March did I decide that I should actually use the membership, so I applied the same principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my habit tracker, I added a new daily task to “Watch 10 minutes of Pluralsight”. I’ve missed only one day (which according to Pluralsight, it was 39 days ago because (as of today) I had just broken my record of a 38 day streak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/how-i-build-habits-1.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;- My Pluralsight profile activity insights as of 24th May 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, by just aiming to watch 10 minutes a day (which sometimes ended up being 20-30 minutes), the results are huge and according to the “View Time” on my profile, the number of hours of content I’ve watched between March – May when compared to January and February has increased quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I watch them at 1.5x speed so the exact number of hours displayed are not accurate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is how I create my habits, I have a daily evening routine which I perform small tasks to remain productive. Here are a few examples which I have adopted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;💪 One set of push-ups (min 15 reps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🦵 One set of squats (min 15 reps)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;📺 Watch 10 minutes of Pluralsight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;📖 Read 10 pages of a book [1]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🍴 Empty dishwasher&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;🌇 Prepare next day’s necessities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small consistent actions and yield big results. There are going to be some people who have more discipline and wouldn’t need their tasks to be as small as mine. However, if you’re not one of these people, then small tasks will work better for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it into persepctive, if we were to do some math on these, assuming the tasks were achieved with no days missed the whole year, that is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum&lt;/strong&gt; total (per annum) of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5475&lt;/strong&gt; push-ups&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5475&lt;/strong&gt; squats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;91.25&lt;/strong&gt; hours of Pluralsight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; books [2]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the results compound and can be huge. Set the ‘minimum’ low and do it consistently to get the benefits from that compound effect, also note that there will often be times where you exceed your ‘minimum’ because the goal itself is designed to be &lt;strong&gt;too easy&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that its possible and likely to be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be some ‘missed’ days that’s okay, I’ve already missed one or two (so far), but the main take-away is that, once the habit is set, you’re going to complete the (small) task more often than you’ll miss them. And because of that compound effect, you’ll yield huge results. 👍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1] The 10 pages task, I don’t do consistently unless I have a book I want to read, however, once I decide on a book, I apply this principle in order to motivate me to complete it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[2] Based on average page size of 273 for a book from this site: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scribewriting.com/how-long-should-book-be/&quot;&gt;Scribe Writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">A guide on how I build habits.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Should Companies Be Hiring Juniors?</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/should-companies-be-hiring-juniors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Should Companies Be Hiring Juniors?" /><published>2020-05-22T17:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-22T17:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/should-companies-be-hiring-juniors</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/should-companies-be-hiring-juniors/">&lt;p&gt;This question was asked by someone on the Slack channel.
Here were some of the responses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sky uses its own grad scheme instead. Very occasionally they hire juniors. Whether they “should be” or not isn’t really for me to answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;in previous companies, it’s pretty much always been lack of bandwidth for mentorship, “we need people who can hit the ground running”, and not being good enough at chunking out junior level work in a way that provides growth and support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That argument always annoys me as i suspect its less true than people think it is. I think some people think juniors are a drain on resource but they fundamentally are another hand at the coal face&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;i definitely think more companies should hire juniors, but i also know a lot of companies where being a junior is actively miserable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;here-was-my-response&quot;&gt;Here was my response:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it largely depends on whether the company has a budget for a junior or not.. If the budget is enough to hire a mid to senior, they would like opt for that option instead of bringing on a junior. If the budget isn’t enough to get a senior or mid level developer then maybe thats when they’d consider it?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mid/Senior devs were once junior devs that were given the chance to grow and learn. They won’t be around forever and if companies don’t allow for new juniors to follow the same path, at some point there’ll be a lack of mid/senior devs as well as juniors with experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;my-response-to-this&quot;&gt;My response to this:&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When this happens, that is when companies will start hiring juniors. The market will adapt based on supply and demand”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I agree that companies can benefit from graduate schemes and/or entry-level developer roles.
But the question is how much of a cost will this be? How much productivity can the junior bring?
When someone joins a company, senior or not, how long for that person getting up to speed, is a big factor.
Not to mention requiring the time of existing developers to assist thus also adding to the cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The best thing for a junior is getting their foot through the door in order to gain things that are of greater value than salary (that this stage of their career) such as the work experience, learning from seniors (like a mentor),  building a good network, references etc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And so I think that as a junior, aim to get the best salary/benefits you can but also acknowledge that it could be a lot lower that you might hope for (for now).  Do this for 6 -12 months, build the experience and knowledge required to justify a higher salary and work up the ‘ladder’ as it were or move on to the next company (which btw can be a salary increase of up to 25% at the early stages).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that suggesting that companies ‘should’ be hiring juniors is a bit of wishful thinking. As mentioned before, junior salaries can be quite high depending where you live. According to a survey of graduating annual salaries at Makers, it averages at £30k, I’m assuming that most of these are juniors as they have just graduated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;£30k starting salary is quite decent, arguably too high for this skill level. On indeed.co.uk, some actual mid-level positions in London are £30k-£40k. The question is whether a junior can provide £30k worth of productivity annually?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a post previously about a related topic: &lt;a href=&quot;/to-hire-a-junior-vs-senior-developer/&quot;&gt;To Hire a Junior Vs Senior Developer&lt;/a&gt; which outlines (my opinion) the differences between juniors and seniors and which would be logically the better choice given you have the budget for only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, salaries should mostly be dictated by what amount of productivity an employer can bring. The more junior you are, the less productivity you can bring when compared to mid-senior level developers, but this can be offset by accepting a lower salary. So the answer to the titled question would depend on whether it is more expensive to hire said junior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, as per my response: If you’re a junior-level developer, consider taking a low salary because in my opinion, the best thing for a junior, is getting their foot through the door first in order to gain things that are of greater value than salary.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">Do any of you work in companies that should be hiring juniors but aren't?

And then somebody left this response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ah. “You should have: –  Preferably 5+ years software development experience including Ruby.” Well, keep in touch if they’re hiring another more junior person&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response to this was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apply anyway. Include a cover letter honestly outlining your skillset and experience. You never know if they wouldn’t consider hiring a junior. That’s how I had gotten a role once&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is true, I had gotten my role at Rentify because I applied for their application, which was for a mid-level (if I remember correctly) and had asked whether they would consider a junior. This had gotten me the opportunity to send my CV and code examples which led to a technical test and then a face-to-face interview where I successfully achieved an offer for the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The junior’s reluctance to apply had inspired me to write this post as I had been in the same position once. And my intiative to apply back then, had gotten me one of the most crucial roles of my career as a junior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software developer job applications on the internet will usually come some requirements for what the employer expects in a candidate. Here is an example from the actual application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;You should have:

- Preferably 5+ years software development experience including Ruby.
- Experience of writing apps using Ruby on Rails or a similar framework.
- Experience of database technologies (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL).
- Good knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Experience of using Git for source control.
- Experience of software development best practices such as pairing and code review.
- Experience of or an interest in learning about infrastructure and operations, mainly in the context of Amazon Web Services.
- Good interpersonal skills and the ability to work with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Fluency in English and the ability to work in the UK without sponsorship.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine this being quite intimidating for job seekers who may not fulfil some of the requirements on this list, especially junior developers. There appears to be a lot here and if you’re just starting out then perhaps your ‘imposter syndrome’ may kick in and deter you from applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice would be, instead of being intimidated by this, take advantage of the information provided. Read through the application and see if you can identify which requirements are (maybe) a &lt;strong&gt;must-have&lt;/strong&gt; and which are &lt;strong&gt;should-have&lt;/strong&gt; / &lt;strong&gt;nice-to-haves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the application, there are some mandatory requirements (in my opinion):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fluency in English&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to work in UK without sponsorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of technology, I can see that you will need &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; experience of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails (or a similar framework)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database technologies i.e. MySQL / PostgresSQL&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Html / CSS / JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is difficult to judge how much you would need in order to satisfy the employer’s requirement, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest in learning about infrastructure and operations (AWS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;good interpersonal skills or experience of best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, those can essentially be ignored, they really ought to be in the ‘bonus/nice to have’ section of the job application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, the one that tends to stand out most is the number of years of experience you ‘should’ or ‘ideally’ have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll run through my thoughts of each category and how I would deal with each if I were applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mandatory-non-technical-requirements&quot;&gt;Mandatory Non-technical Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requirements like “ability to work in UK without sponsorship” are likely to be deal-breakers for the employer if they added these in to the job spec.  Other things like “fluency in English” also may fit into this category, if they need you to be able to speak English well, then that may be non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So its worth looking elsewhere if this is the case, although &lt;strong&gt;it doesn’t hurt to ask!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-requirements&quot;&gt;Technology Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I think is where the experience level can be flexible a little bit, the reason being, is that you don’t actually know what the employer requires you to work on at this stage. You have an idea of the tech stack however, and so this is where you can use this knowledge to your advantage. Obviously if you have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; experience with requirements like Ruby or Ruby on Rails, then perhaps the role isn’t necessarily for you, but at the same time &lt;strong&gt;it doesn’t mean you can’t learn it in the meantime&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruby / Ruby on Rails&lt;/strong&gt; - I’m assuming that the applicant will have at least some experience of this, if the applicant specialises in a different technology their chances of success when applying for other roles related to that would be greater. But lets say the applicant has little (but some) experience, the employer/interviewer can only really gauge your skill level on either the technical test or the verbal interview (either face-to-face or phone). This is actually one of the reasons why technical tests are usually part of the application process, its easy to say how good you are at something on paper, you’ll still need to prove it. Having some code examples or personal portfolio would also help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database technologies i.e. MySQL&lt;/strong&gt; - It would be advantageous to know some SQL, but developers using frameworks like RoR tend to rely on the migration features anyway. So I wouldn’t worry too much about it at this stage so long as you know the basics, and again, its something that you can learn meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML / CSS / JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; - Seeing JavaScript placed in the same bullet-point as HTML and CSS suggests that its used but not widely within the tech stack, again its worth having some experience in it. I would think that it can be learned on the job (if the application is successful) and therefore not to worry about limited knowledge on it at this stage either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git&lt;/strong&gt; - It would be good to learn the basics of version control for sure. Can be learned while applying or on the job, not necessarily mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;additional-thoughts-on-this&quot;&gt;Additional thoughts on this&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that I wouldn’t think of these are deal-breakers if you cannot fulfil the requirement. It is unlikely the employer will completely reject your application if you, for example, had &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; experience in Ruby but none in MySQL. Same with having experience with Ruby on Rails but no experience in version control with Git before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if there is a gap in your knowledge base, learn while applying for these roles. The better your knowledge, the greater your success rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preferably-x-years-of-experience&quot;&gt;Preferably x years of experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one I think deters people the most. In my opinion I consider it to be too arbitrary. I’m not saying we should ignore it, it does give some indication what level they’re expecting which should be in line with the expected salary. But its possible to have 0 years of &lt;strong&gt;professional experience&lt;/strong&gt; but self-taught enough to be able to perform well in the role. So I would bear this in mind and apply anyway, doesn’t matter if you have 1, 2, 4 or 7 years of experience, just apply for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even if&lt;/strong&gt; the chances for an interview are low, say 5%, the odds for an interview is &lt;strong&gt;0% if you don’t apply at all&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t hurt to apply. Remember that your odds for an interview is &lt;strong&gt;0%&lt;/strong&gt; if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is based of my own personal experience and my advice is that you might as well apply to see whether you will be considered for the next stage (which could be a technical test or face to face interview).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no guarantee that you will get to that stage &lt;strong&gt;even if you did fulfil each requirement&lt;/strong&gt;. Its also possible that you may only fulfil only some requirements and there may be leeway with the employer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they need the role to be filled, they may be willing to at least have a conversation with you, which is your opportunity to convince them to make you an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t forget that you will likely be competing with other people as well, so don’t stop there, apply for many other job applications. The more you apply for, the greater your success rate. Maybe one of them will convert to an interview and potentially lead to an offer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">Applying for developer roles is not as complicated as one would think.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Is PHP Bad?</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/is-php-bad/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Is PHP Bad?" /><published>2020-05-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/is-php-bad</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/is-php-bad/">&lt;p&gt;I’m subscribed to the subreddit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/&quot;&gt;/r/programmerhumour&lt;/a&gt; - dedicated to humor and jokes relating to programmers and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/is-php-bad-3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of great memes and jokes but my favourite has to be the hate that PHP gets on here. Its very amusing to see how offended some people get. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/ezornw/pppphp/&quot;&gt;Here’s one example&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-php-disliked&quot;&gt;Why is PHP disliked?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think PHP has a lot of dislike primarily because of the experience of working with it. Here is a somewhat famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/&quot;&gt;blog post about PHP&lt;/a&gt;. This outlines a very detailed view of the poor design choices of the language, some of which have since been addressed in later PHP versions but still are things to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common ‘pro’ for PHP is that a lot of sites on the internet was built with it. My counter argument to this is, just because a lot of websites on the internet are built with PHP, doesn’t mean that the code behind them are good. There is a reason why PHP code often associated with ‘Legacy’ code, its too easy to write code that ‘works’ but also poor and unmaintainable. The argument that, majority of sites are built with PHP does not necessarily mean that that is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common ‘pro’ is that Facebook is built with PHP. While this is true, Facebook also created a new programming language called &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacklang.org/&quot;&gt;Hack&lt;/a&gt; to alleviate the problems and headaches their developers were having when working with PHP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mostly subjective when people say bad things about PHP (including me). Their experience working with are also anecdotes. But if you’re asking on a forum for someone’s opinion, you need to expect at least this much. Having experienced PHP professionally, I can kind of see why it gets a lot of hate. When comparing it to other languages, it is the one I would recommend the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;is-it-worth-learning-php-anyway&quot;&gt;Is it worth learning PHP anyway?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHP over the years has gotten much better now. Its faster and frameworks associated with the language  help with a lot of its problems. So using frameworks like Laravel can certainly help with the overall experience. If you can get past the awkward and clunkiness aspects of PHP, then by all means learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the only strong reason I would consider PHP is because of job opportunities. If you have a lot of PHP opportunities in the area you live then it makes sense to learn it. However, if there are job opportunities in Python, C#, Java, Ruby or any other modern programming language, I personally would recommend those instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;why-do-programmers-advise-new-programmers-to-ignore-learning-php&quot;&gt;Why do programmers advise new programmers to ignore learning PHP?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I’ve responded to a question somebody asked on Quora:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/Why-do-programmers-advise-new-programmers-to-ignore-learning-PHP&quot;&gt;Why do programmers advise new programmers to ignore learning PHP?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarise my response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;its because the low learning curve and the flexibility of the language ironically allows new programmers to ignore best practices and learn bad habits really quickly if they’re not careful. The tutorials availble online are often out of date and are terrible to begin with. This can be a detriment to their growth as a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve left some examples of my own personal experiences with PHP and why I believed that PHP is not particularly a great programming language to start off with. Though in hindsight, my reasoning in the response is not necessarily an issue exclusive to PHP, and any dynamically typed language can experience this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe that excerpt isn’t a valid reason why PHP in particular is bad. A lot of the counter arguments are often related to the bad code being the result of developers instead of the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/is-php-bad-2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may be true, I still feel that when compared to other programming languages, PHP is the least enjoyable to work with in my experience. The syntax can be an eyesore, its very noticable when a third-party service supports multiple programming languages and you can toggle between them in their documentation, PHP is in my opinion the ugliest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues from setting up a development environment to inheriting legacy projects in PHP is also less than ideal. In my experience, it seems harder to get up and running as a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is PHP bad? Not necessarily. Is PHP bad when compared to other modern programming languages? In my opinion, I would say yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there isn’t anything that PHP particularly excels in. All modern programming languages can do what PHP can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other more enjoyable programming languages. Languages such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C# all can basically do what PHP can and more. They all have frameworks, libraries, package managers and open source projects available. &lt;strong&gt;So when factoring all of PHP’s pros and cons, what can PHP do great which other languages can’t&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend a beginner learn PHP? Only if there are no other opportunities which uses a different programming language. If the area you live in has opportunities in Python, Java, C# or Javascript/NodeJS/Typescript, then I would highly recommend those languages instead. Its only worth learning PHP if there are no other options in terms of job opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it is still good to have an open mind, anyone defending/attacking PHP should hopefully have had experience with it as well as other languages before casting judgement. Best to avoid focusing on what other people think and enjoy the memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/is-php-bad-1.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height: 400px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">The best meme in /r/ProgrammerHumor</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Git Workflow</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/git-workflow/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Git Workflow" /><published>2020-04-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/git-workflow</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/git-workflow/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just started a new role there, they were not using any version control (which led to many problems) and so Git was introduced into their workflow by the tech lead who had also just started his role a month prior.
Within the team and the work they were doing - there were so many issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Huge merge conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trying to commit without staging work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-lived branches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Out-of-date local master and feature branches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merging other people’s branches&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hot fixes for bugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Undoing commits or deleting them thus losing work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had just joined the team, I had worked with Git for a few years, so I was asked on many occasions to explain to my colleagues where they may have gone wrong and what they need to do to fix it. There was one QA engineer in particular who was struggling to grasp the basics even after many conversations with him. So I took it upon myself to prepare a document so the team can refer to if they get stuck or I can use to help explain things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the original document I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;git-clarification&quot;&gt;Git Clarification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first clarification I think is important to remember is the fundamental idea that Git tracks &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Commits as the &lt;strong&gt;state&lt;/strong&gt; of the codebase. So, if you branch off master for example, you have all of master’s &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;. In the new branch you add some code then &lt;strong&gt;Commit&lt;/strong&gt; it, your branch has those &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; including master’s &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; (since you last git pulled) but master will not have your new &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; (until you merge them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/git-workflow-1.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-diagram&quot;&gt;Basic Diagram&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This here is a basic diagram for what maybe is a typical feature you guys might be working on. The lines represent branches and the &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; are the represented by circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/git-workflow-2.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example is the scenario of working on a feature with two user stories (&lt;strong&gt;US-1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt;).
Master is branched off into a new ‘feature’ branch, then the feature branch is to be branched off into the &lt;strong&gt;US-1&lt;/strong&gt; branch. &lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt; is also branched off the feature branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US-1&lt;/strong&gt; is finished first, a pull request is opened then merged back into the feature branch (if approved). Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt; is being worked on, once it is ready, before opening a pull request, pull from the feature branch (which contains &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;US-1&lt;/strong&gt;), then open a pull request into the feature branch. This will allow your branch (&lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt;) to be ‘up to date’ with the feature branch if this makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt; is approved and merged into the feature branch. A new pull request can be made from ‘feature branch’ to ‘Master’. This feature branch by now will contain &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; from both &lt;strong&gt;US-1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;US-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everything is merged into master, we create a separate branch for the release. Remember, git only tracks the &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt;, so in this scenario, the release branch will contain exactly the same &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; as master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advance-diagram&quot;&gt;Advance Diagram&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above diagram is designed to be basic so it’s easier to explain. The below diagram is designed to demonstrate exactly what is happening in the same scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/git-workflow-3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you have to bear in mind is that you have your Local Repository and there is a Remote Repository. Your local one is the one stored on your machine and the remote is on Azure DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each repository will have their own branches. So technically (in this example) there are two master branches, one local and one remote. It is your responsibility to make sure that your local master branch is up to date with the remote master branch as it is possible that it has been updated since you’ve last ‘pulled’ down the changes into your local master while working on your feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to open your pull request, you actually need to push your branch into the Remote repo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example also demonstrates what happens if your pull request is rejected or requires some change. You add more &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; to your Local repo and then push those &lt;strong&gt;Commits&lt;/strong&gt; to the Remote repo branch, it will just appear in the pull request to be reviewed again, you don’t need to create a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everything is approved and merged. A new release branch is created and you can pull master to update your Local master branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: These examples are under the assumption that a single developer is working on this feature. If there is a feature where the user stories are being worked on by multiple developers, then the feature branch would normally be available on the Remote Repo first, and you all work off that branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bonus-hot-fixes&quot;&gt;Bonus: Hot Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example how to deal with Hotfixes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/git-workflow-4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Branch off the Release&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix/patch the bug.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open a pull request against the Release branch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge if approved&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge into master as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-thoughts&quot;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example demonstrates the Git workflow we were working with. I believe its commonly known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&quot;&gt;Gitflow Workflow&lt;/a&gt;. We had release and feature branches along with tickets that had sub-tasks and/or user-stories which meant having to create a feature branch and branching off that to create ‘user-story’ branches. Not to mention applying patch/hot fixes. It isn’t my prefered Git Workflow and anecdotally can be very confusing for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of workflow requires a good understanding of how Git works and so it is unsurprising that the team struggled to grasp the basics and ran into so many issues. While I was happy to help them with this, it did take a lot of patience to explain and assist with their branches and commits, which at times were pretty disruptive for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not necessarily saying that my document here is particularly good, and my diagrams/notes can be improved but I remember that I didn’t want to spend too much effort on it at the time. Having look at those now, I wonder if they added to the confusion? I wouldn’t know how else to simplify it further to be honest, it was a real challenge trying to teach my colleagues this topic, I could sense their frustration and sometimes their unwillingness to learn this topic at all. Having to explain to them ‘why’ was very difficult and I suppose they wished they could’ve reverted back to the old way of working before the tech lead had made this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking back on this experience, in my opinion, it was probably not a good idea for the tech lead to transition everyone to a new (version-control) system they were not familiar with, without first giving them time to learn and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would’ve been much more effective to run through a workshop to teach the basics instead of carrying on and trying to fix the conflicts and challenges as they arise (to improve knowledge on Git). Also just sending an article/blog about Git via email is good but will not be effective if no one actually spends time to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I would’ve prefered we used a more simple Git Workflow such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/&quot;&gt;GitHub Flow&lt;/a&gt; to avoid overwhelming them with some of Git’s more complicated features (present in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&quot;&gt;Gitflow Workflow&lt;/a&gt;) while they learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll one day, now that I have some experience with both Git Workflows, write a blog post to compare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow&quot;&gt;Gitflow Workflow&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/&quot;&gt;GitHub Flow&lt;/a&gt; and see the pros/cons of each workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">At a previous company, many of my colleagues had little to no experience with version-control.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyone have any advice on how to fill in the “Expected Salary” field of a job application? Of note:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have just graduated from Makers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I have three years of previous professional experience, but not as a dev&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The job title is “Junior DevOps Engineer”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;I would really like to say something like “negotiable” but don’t know if that’s bad form&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If I need to put a number, can I put a range?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to see the various responses to this question. Some were saying to not provide a salary range or expected salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;here-are-some-of-the-responses&quot;&gt;Here are some of the responses:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;avoid answering that question as much as you can, and if you have to, a range is fine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, there is no obligation to answer that question. If it’s a required field I’d use their own tricks against them and go with “competitive”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;fwiw, from being on the interviewer side, and having talked to recruitment about it, usually it’s to make sure there isn’t a massive expectation gap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;for more aggressive recruiters it is also so that they have the upper hand in negotiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One person did write a pretty good response which I think it’s worth mentioning in its own section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-great-response&quot;&gt;A Great Response&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t avoid the question - put an exact number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why? The employer will have a salary range in mind. why place yourself at the bottom end or below before you’ve even started the process with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You could also put yourself at the top end? You should always know the band before so you can’t really go below, unless you really dont rate yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that by not answering the question you’re effectively saying that you’re open to anything within their band, and when negotiating you haven’t got a leg to stand on if they offer you the bottom end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s roughly the same as giving an expected salary range like 30-40k - it’s usually interpreted as ‘I think i’m worth 30k but 40k would be nice’.If you’d be happy with the bottom end then, however the conversation would be very different than if you just ask for 40k, which says ‘I know what i’m worth and what I want’. It gives you leverage when negotiating and prevents them wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing here is not to overreach, find the number that you would be happy with and say yes to , then maybe add a few more £££. If it feels like too much then it probably is, if you genuinely think you can get more then you probably can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t think that giving a number will mean they wont negotiate still, you can still ask or be offered more or less  after you go through the hiring process - it just gives you something to anchor to really”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;my-response-to-this&quot;&gt;My Response To This&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreed. When negotiating, you’re going to need to see where you stand in the process. Providing a range will just give the employer an idea of how much you’re willing to take at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets say as an example, the company wants to make an offer, your range is [&lt;strong&gt;£30k&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;£40k&lt;/strong&gt;] and you tell the company a fixed number of &lt;strong&gt;£40k&lt;/strong&gt;. If the company accepts, you win. If the company provides a counter offer of slightly lower, say &lt;strong&gt;£38k&lt;/strong&gt; then you still win. In this scenario, you might even counter that and meet them halfway with &lt;strong&gt;£39k&lt;/strong&gt;. Win Win!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No employer will be offering higher than they need to, I wouldn’t think. Unless it’s part of their strategy to increase the chances of you accepting their offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;my-actual-response-to-the-discussion&quot;&gt;My actual response to the discussion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was my contribution to the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever ‘expected salary’ you provide will be likely be used as an indicator for what skill level &lt;strong&gt;you think you’re at&lt;/strong&gt;, also the company will look at this and match it with &lt;strong&gt;what they think&lt;/strong&gt; based on your interview performance or first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming they want to make you an offer, here is what I believe will be the various scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you give a salary expectation where its similar to what they think and is within their budget, they’ll likely make you the offer around a similar range or slightly higher to increase the chances of you accepting&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you give a low salary expectation and its within their budget, they will either make you an offer of the same amount (thus saving some money) or they will make it slightly higher to increase the chances of you accepting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you give a reasonably high salary expectation and it is within their budget while also more than they think you’re worth, they may make you an offer anyway with the probationary period in place to monitor your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you give an outrageously high salary expectation, they may or may not take you seriously and possibly retract the offer altogether if not make a counter offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, make a high offer but be realistic based on your experience level. Also be prepared to back up your offer with reasons why you feel its a fair offer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might as well aim high but realistic to your experience level. There is no harm in being up-front about what your salary expectations are. And there is no harm in negotiating or renegotiating a salary if an offer is made, its all part of the game. But bear in mind that it needs to be a win-win situation for everyone to be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good salary isn’t necessarily all you should be thinking about, there are many other things to consider when negotiating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you currently in employment? If not, then you have less negotiating power&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have other offers on the table you can use as leverage?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What was your previous salary and would you accept lower?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the work/life balance like at the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What else can you bring to the company?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How is the commute to work?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What else does the company offer in terms of benefits?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the company already have a short-list of candidates they’ve already to made offers to? (You wouldn’t know the answer to this but better to assume they have)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about what else you might be gaining. Such as a stable job, a good working environment? Will you be working in a good team? Have a good manager? Working on a cool project? Are there any learning opportunities? etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things should be considered when thinking about the offer, sometimes its not necessarily a bad thing to accept a lower salary but then also receiving a lot of other benefits as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally would much rather choose a position with a sensible or fair salary that has great benefits instead of a position where it pays extremely well but everything else from work/life balance to who you’re working with is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">My opinion on whether providing an expected salary when applying for a role.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to SNS and SQS</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/introduction-to-sqs-and-sns/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to SNS and SQS" /><published>2020-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/introduction-to-sqs-and-sns</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/introduction-to-sqs-and-sns/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;agenda&quot;&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is SQS?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is SNS?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The difference between SNS and SQS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advantages of using SNS and SQS together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be running through briefly, what is SQS before moving on to, what is SNS? The differences between the two and the advantages of using them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-amazons-simple-queue-service-sqs&quot;&gt;What is Amazon’s Simple Queue Service (SQS)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sqs-logo.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available
 
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;sqs-offers-two-types-of-message-queues&quot;&gt;SQS offers two types of message queues:&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Standard Queues&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;FIFO (First in, First Out) Queues&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Unlimited Throughput: Support a nearly unlimited number of transactions per second per API action.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;High Throughput: By default, FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Best-Effort Ordering: Occasionally, messages might be delivered in an order different from which they were sent.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Exactly-Once Processing: A message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it. Duplicates aren’t introduced into the queue.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;At-Least-Once Delivery: A delivered at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;First-In-First-Out Delivery: The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved (i.e. First-In-First-Out).&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sqs-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sqs-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;working-with-sqs-messages&quot;&gt;Working with SQS Messages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Messages are persisted and is stored for some configurable duration. The default is 4 days but it can be up to 14 days before they’re automatically deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Messages can contain up to 256 KB of text data, including XML, JSON and unformatted text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An external service is needed to poll and grab messages from SQS to process. Once the service has successfully processed them, the message can be deleted from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternatively, you can configure your queue to trigger a lambda function to process the message. The lambda will only delete the message from the queue if your function has returned successfully without any errors. If the function fails to process, a &lt;strong&gt;dead-letter queue&lt;/strong&gt; can be leveraged to store those failed messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-a-dead-letter-queue-dlq&quot;&gt;What is a Dead-letter queue (DLQ)?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dead-letter queue is simply an SQS queue for messages that can’t be delivered successfully, for example due to client or server errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those messages can be held in this queue for reprocessing, we can also configure an alarm for messages arriving into this queue, as well as examine them for further analysis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quick-summary&quot;&gt;Quick Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fully managed message queuing service&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send, store, and receive messages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Lambda triggers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dead letter queue support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just a quick summary, SQS is a fully managed queuing service. It can send store and receive messages. It supports lambda triggers and can be used as a dead letter queue for storing failed messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-amazons-simple-notification-service-sns&quot;&gt;What is Amazon’s Simple Notification Service (SNS)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-logo.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;
SNS is a fully managed publish/subscribe messaging service that coordinates and manages the delivery or sending of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides ‘topics’ which are messaging channels that any number of subscribers can subscribe to. When the Topic receives an event or message, it pushes it to all subscribers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
 
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of clients to be aware of, subscribers and publishers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;subscribers&quot;&gt;Subscribers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web servers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SQS queues&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lambda functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscribers (i.e. web servers, email addresses,  SQS queues,  Lambda functions) consume or receive messages from the topic they’re subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;publishers&quot;&gt;Publishers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publishers such as distributed systems, microservices and other AWS services can communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending messages to an SNS topic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-usage&quot;&gt;Basic Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-2.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use SNS, a topic needs to be created. We can control access to it by defining policies that determine which publishers and subscribers can communicate with it.
 
A message is sent directly to the topic. SNS matches the topic to a list of subscribers who have subscribed to it, and delivers the message to each of those subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll run through some common scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-message-fanout&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Message Fanout&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So message fanout occurs when a message, is published to a topic, which is then pushed to multiple subscribers or endpoints.
This provides asynchronous event notifications, which in turn allows for parallel processing.  
 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-3.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine a topic which has some SQS queues subscribed to it, and imagine we have an application that sends a message to this topic whenever an order is placed for a product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an order is placed, the SQS queues would receive identical messages for that new order at the same time. A service receiving the message from one of the queues could be responsible for the processing of the order, while the other queue can be used by a different service to store the ‘order data’ in a database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-4.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 200px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-application-and-system-alerts&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Application and System Alerts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application and System alerts, so notifications or alerts that are triggered by a breach of predefined thresholds for monitoring for example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-5.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 150px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-scenarios&quot;&gt;Other Scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Scenarios can be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push email or text messaging i.e. Targeted news headlines to subscribers by email or SMS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile push notifications i.e. Send messages directly to mobile apps, indicating that an update is available for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-6.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;message-delivery-retries&quot;&gt;Message Delivery Retries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNS defines a delivery policy for each delivery protocol. The delivery policy defines how SNS, retries the delivery of a message if it is undeliverable for whatever reason.
 
Apart from HTTP, delivery protocols do not support custom delivery policies, so you can’t customise SNS-defined delivery policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the delivery policy is exhausted, SNS stops retrying the delivery and discards the message. Although, if a dead-letter queue, is configured to the subscription however, then the message will be held there. The dead letter queue is configured on the subscription rather than a topic because message deliveries happen at the subscription level.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;Messages are persisted for some (configurable) duration&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Push mechanism - Messages are pushed to subscribers/consumers&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Pull mechanism - Receivers must poll and pull messages&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system.  There is no persistence, so the message isn’t stored by SNS.
Leveraging SNS allows for processing the same message in multiple ways and at the same time. It uses a push mechanism, so messages are pushed to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas SQS is a queuing system, used for decoupling applications and allowing parallel asynchronous processing.  Messages are persisted and is stored for some configurable duration. It can be up to 14 days before they’re automatically deleted
SQS uses a pull mechanism – So messages are NOT pushed to receivers. Receivers would have to poll or pull messages. Although SQS does support lambda triggers so we don’t necessarily have to poll for messages, we can leverage that instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-might-we-use-sns-with-sqs-together&quot;&gt;Why might we use SNS with SQS together?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/media/sns-8.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 250px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be different kinds of subscribers of the same topic where, some need the immediate delivery of messages such as alerts or email. But others might require the message to persist, for later usage or processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;asynchronous-processing&quot;&gt;Asynchronous Processing&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a message is published to a topic, it can be distributed to multiple SQS queues which can then be processed in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;persistent-storage&quot;&gt;Persistent Storage&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging SQS, the message can be stored, the service can poll and receive the message as and when it decides. If the service were to become unavailable for some reason, the message would still be available within the queue.  Once the service is available again, it can then continue to poll and process those messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;dead-letter-queue&quot;&gt;Dead letter queue&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If SNS pushes a notification directly to a subscribed Service, and that service is unavailable, then the message will be lost. Leveraging dead-letter queues will solve this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, even if the service has ‘received’ the message. What happens if an error occurs during processing or that processing fails? The message can be pushed to this queue making it available for repossessing or further analysis. And configured to only delete the message when processed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;achieve-guaranteed-delivery&quot;&gt;Achieve Guaranteed Delivery&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So by coupling SNS with SQS, we can achieve guaranteed delivery by receiving messages at our own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize:
SNS distributes several copies of the same message to several subscribers, to be processed in parallel.
SQS is mainly used to decouple or integrate applications. It also allows clients to be offline and is tolerant to network and host failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coupling the two together we can achieve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parallel asynchronous processing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fault tolerant systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guaranteed delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the other benefits mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that concludes my basic overview of the SNS and SQS.
We’ve covered what is SQS, what is SNS, the difference between the two and the advantages of using them together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">So for this post I'll be covering a basic overview of Amazon's Simple Queue Service (known as SQS) and Amazon's Simple Notification Service (known as SNS).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mocking In JS</title><link href="http://jameslieu.github.io/mocking-in-js/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mocking In JS" /><published>2020-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://jameslieu.github.io/mocking-in-js</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://jameslieu.github.io/mocking-in-js/">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to compare the libraries we’re currently using for mocking in our tests.
The two primary libraries we’re using are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Proxyquire&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sinon&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we’re using those interchangeably, and there seems to be some confusion to which one we should use or sometimes even both are used in the same test. The initial motivation for writing this blog was because of some of the challenges or confusion that we have faced when attempting to mock/stub the AWS SDK in our unit tests. So I have put together these notes to compare the ways we can achieve the same test for each library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;proxyquire&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire&quot;&gt;Proxyquire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes over require and lets you inject fakes anywhere in the dependency chain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thus it still loads the original, just replaces things with what you define.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;sinonjs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon&quot;&gt;SinonJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t take over require&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s a more traditional mocking framework. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace specified methods with fakes, &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a mock that tracks when it was called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some example code I can use to demonstrate both Proxyquire and Sinon to see the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;aws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;aws-sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exampleFunction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sqs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;aws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;receiveParams&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;QueueUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;http://example.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MaxNumberOfMessages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;WaitTimeSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sqs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;receiveMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;receiveParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sqs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sendMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic example of using the aws-sdk library. We have an exampleFunction which calls SQS’s receiveMessage which then calls the sendMessage if the call was successful. If the sendMessage call is successful we assign the response to the result variable which is then returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below we’ll show an example of how we might write a unit test (for success) for this with each library so we can compare the two:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;proxyrequire-example&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire&quot;&gt;Proxyrequire&lt;/a&gt; Example&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;proxyquire&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;proxyquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;ava&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;test exampleFunction returns bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;receiveMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sendMessage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;awsSdkSqsExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;proxyquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;../src/aws-sdk-sqs-example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;aws-sdk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;awsSdkSqsExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;exampleFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Proxyquire, we can take over the require statement to import the exampleFunction but also creating fake data to replace the actual aws-sdk functions in order to assert the values we want. Proxyquire will only replace the functions which we define while still allowing the other available functions to work and be used as normal. Which means Proxyquire can work very well as a feature test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I also noticed (particularly with this example) was that there interesting behavior in regards to validation. The receiveMessage function has validation. If the receiveParams passed in were to be invalid, then the Promise will be rejected. This can be considered a positive or negative outcome as it encourages the tests to be written with valid parameters but at the same time its not a true mock/stub and was a little unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you can’t do is assert the stub. we can only assert the values based off what we’ve stubbed and returned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;sinon-example&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon&quot;&gt;Sinon&lt;/a&gt; Example&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;awsSdkSqsExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;../src/aws-sdk-sqs-example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinon is considered a ‘true’ mock/stub/spy framework. It is also familiar in its use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external libraries/classes/functions are completely mocked and thus allowing more flexibility, particularly with asserting them (including the number of times a mock as called). Not only can we determine what is returned from a function, we can configure the different return values depending on how many times a function is called i.e. a difference value if the function was called a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to use both at the same time. Although its worth considering what value this might bring if the test can be achieved with just one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;actual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;expected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its worth also mentioning that specifically for mocking the aws-sdk there is another library we can use, aws-sdk-mock. This library is really designed for syntactic sugar and actually uses Sinon to do its mocking. It does look cleaner and more readable. So this can also be an option to consider as well. There does seem to be a limitation for asserting whether the mock was called but I believe there is an option to use a “Sinon Spy” with this library which then allows for adding those assertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any of the above libraries are fit for our use cases. And there’s nothing particularly wrong with using all three. And the examples that were provided are very basic and may not even be the best way of writing those tests, there are more functionality and utility that I can see in the official documentation so its worth having a look at those as well (links are at the bottom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its worth thinking about considering some consistency in how we use these libraries, to avoid confusion as well as improve maintainability of our own tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, Proxyquire feels more intuitive than Sinon. Once the ‘stubs’ are defined, its can become clearer to read what will happen once those are called. The advantage of defining exactly which functions needs stubbing allows for the some degree of ‘feature testing’ which can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re unit testing, we need to decide how ‘isolated’ is our test going to be, if we’re intending to test in full isolation then Sinon would be a better fit. Not only does it fully mock/stub the external libraries/functions (including assertions), but we’re also familiar with its ‘style’ as it is similar to other mocking frameworks we’re used to and currently using in other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

https://journal.plausible.io/you-probably-dont-need-a-single-page-app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It all comes down to tradeoffs
As with everything in programming, there isn’t a single answer in the SPA vs traditional architecture dilemma. There are cases where it makes sense to go with a SPA because you need a snappy, real-time UI. However, we should recognize that this comes at a cost to the development speed. And if a single-page app is not a requirement, we can avoid the additional complexity and move much quicker by going the traditional route.
Picking the right architecture for the job makes a huge difference in productivity, and ultimately, success. We should aim to have both architectures in our toolbox, so we can use the optimal solution in each case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if this article was a bash at JS developers, but more so debating whether ‘defaulting’ to SPAs is the best solution as a starting point. Why not just build your app in NodeJS/ExpressJS, thats still Javascript and I don’t see anything wrong with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have some personal experience with this in my previous company, we were rewriting a legacy app, it used to be built with Ruby on Rails but the company wanted to use PHP instead primarily because of how difficult it was to find a Rails dev (in Milton Keynes). The senior developer and myself had started at the same time, But he being the senior there had selected the tech stack: Laravel API with an Angular 2 (SPA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing with Laravel was a breeze and he was already well-versed with it, but why did he go for Angular 2? Or an SPA for that matter. When I asked him, he basically said that it was ‘modern’ (and I wouldn’t be surprised if he just wanted to learn the tech).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of developing with it, he openly admitted regretting going that route when comparing to just using the Laravel framework to handle everything incl the front end, then perhaps going with the hybrid option and using VueJS to apply the rich UI interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems we’ve had with Angular were error handling, guards, intercepting calls (to handle refresh tokens) to name a few. These things can go completely without when going the traditional route, Laravel would’ve handled that stuff for us out of the box. I personally don’t regret learning Angular but I can see why my colleague says he has regrets over it, it took us substantially longer to develop anything and the question was whether it was even &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;this particular app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SPA route ‘arguably’ adds extra complexity and setup costs when compared to the traditional route and I think that was where the author of that article was getting at.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>James Lieu</name></author><summary type="html">There was a short debate I had with some people regarding whether SPAs are necessary based off an article on the subject.</summary></entry></feed>
