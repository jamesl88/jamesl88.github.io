Hi, I am James Lieu, a developer.

I've experienced creative side of the industry and from there I have discovered the technical. 
Learning to code provides the right amount of challenge as well as a chance to work with passionate and creative people.

I love the fact that coding presents the opportunity for me to design, create and to constantly educate myself.
