Hi my name is James Lieu, I'm a graduate of [makersacademy.com](http://makersacademy.com/)


I've experienced creative side of the industry and from there I have discovered the technical.

Learning to code provides the right amount of challenge as well as a chance to work with passionate and creative people.

I love the fact that coding presents the opportunity for me to design, create and to constantly educate myself.

I've started this blog to keep track of any programming snippets or tips I found useful and would like to share.
