Hi, I am James Lieu, a Software engineer.

With a background in Illustration and Animation, I evolved my career to become a full-time web developer, firstly by taking a leap of faith and enrolling in the web development bootcamp known as Makers Academy (makersacademy.com).

I enjoy programming as it provides a challenging environment as well as the opportunity to work with passionate and creative people.

I also appreciate the chance it offers for me to design, create and constantly educate myself.

- Javascript

- GIT
- Rspec (incl RR)
- ReactJS (currently studying)
