I've managed to achieve the 100 day learning streak for Pluralsight

A few months ago, I've written a post about [how I build habits](/how-i-build-habits), where I outline a method I use to create habits that allow me to perform tasks consistently in a maintainable way.

By applying this method, I have managed to watch Pluralsight daily for **100 days straight**. I'd thought it would be good to share this milestone as well as reinforce the idea that **small consistent actions can make a big impact on the end result**.

By only aiming to watch a minimum of 10 minutes of Pluralsight videos a day, I was able to consume so much content. Here are the receipts:

_My Personal Profile as of 24th July 2020_

So here is my 100 day learning streak insight. It also states I've watched 75+ hours of content, this is not actually the case, Pluralsight does not account for when you watch the courses are a higher speed i.e. 1.5x - 2.0x speed.

The audio for the videos seem to also be artificially slowed which seems a little disingenuous as it means the courses duration are not quite the length they say they are. I mention this in my [Pluralsight review](/pluralsight-review)

Now onto the courses:

_All the courses I've watched so far as of 24th July 2020_

The 'red badge' icon on the left of each course listed, are the ones I've completed. There were a few I didn't finish watching because I either found not relevant, or I was already well-versed on the remaining videos or I'm currently watching them.

Bear in mind that this history includes courses completed even before the start of my streak. In fact, with the exception of two days (one in March and another in April), I've been watching Pluralsight daily since **February 24th 2020**:

 _My daily streaks up until October (when I purchased the subscription)_

I remember those days I missed, each one I had basically forgotten to watch it that day, they were also days where my evening was unusually busy (on both days). Had I not broken my streak both times, my daily learning streak would've been **151 days** today

## Summary &#x1f4dd;

As mentioned, I was really only able to achieve this due to [building a habit](/how-i-build-habits). I highly recommend having a read to help you achieve your goals, whether its to exercise more or read more, this is an excellent way to get started.

Will I continue with this habit? Probably, my company did pay for a annual subscription, so it'd be a good idea to get as much value from it as I can. I don't regret consuming this much content, they're very educational and very relevant to my career.

It doesn't look like anything special happens once I reached this milestone. It would be nice for Pluralsight to acknowledge it by sending an email or introduce achievement badges of some sort, perhaps that would encourage me to aim even higher, 200 daily streaks? 1 year? Regardless, its not really that important.

Would I recommend Pluralsight? [See my review here](/pluralsight-review).


In any case, I'm pretty proud of my 100 day streak milestone!
