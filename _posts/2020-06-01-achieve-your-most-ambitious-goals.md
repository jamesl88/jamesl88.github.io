I highly recommend this TED talk: [How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE)

The author talks about how he applies marginal changes in his routine to get things done.

> Even a marginal improvement in our process can have a huge impact on our end result.

## Putting it into Practice &#x1f3c3;

Imagine wanting to finish a book &#x1f4d6;.

Instead of thinking about the end goal of reading the whole thing, change your mindset to think about the smallest step to achieving that goal instead.

Start with **one word**,  that step of reading **one word** becomes reading **two words**, then **ten words**. That then becomes reading **one paragraph** which then becomes reading **a chapter** so on and so fourth until you finish your book. &#x1f4d5;

### &#x1f60a; Even the tiniest action is worthwhile

How I currently [build my habit](/how-i-build-habits) for reading, is to just set the task to **10 pages**. Still a small task, not quite as small as starting with a single word, I do like this idea of breaking that task down even further. Progressing with the mentality that even the tiniest action is worthwhile and that those actions can compound, which can have a huge impact on our end result.

It is this mindset that can motivate you to do _something_. To progress you into the right direction whatever that may be.

Simply putting down the tv remote can be considered its own action, putting on your running clothes, stepping out of your front door, take one step, then two steps then a walk, then a jog, then you'll be running before you know it &#x1f3c3;.

## Summary &#x1f4dd;

This mindset resonates with [how I build my habits](/how-i-build-habits).

Instead of focusing on the end result and risk being put off by it, focus on the smallest step first, even doing just that is still progress, and if you're able to do this consistently, you'll be surprised how productive you can be.

Remember the key take away:

**Make any task more approachable and apply a marginal adjustment to your routine.** &#x1f4aa; &#x1f4aa;
