I highly recommend this TED talk: [How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE)

The author talks about how he applies even the smallest change in his routine to get things done.

> Even a marginal improvement in our process can have a huge impact on our end result.



## Putting it in Practice &#x1f3c3;

Imagine needing to read a book &#x1f4d6;.

Instead of thinking about reading the whole thing, change your mindset to think **a lot** smaller.

Start with **one word**,  that **one word** becomes **two words**, those **two words**  becomes **ten words**.  That then becomes **one paragraph** which then becomes **a chapter** so on and so fourth until you complete your book. &#x1f4d5;

### &#x1f60a; Insignificant actions does not mean that its not worthwhile

How I currently build my habit for reading is to just set the task to 10 pages which is still a small task, not quite as small as starting with a single word but I do like that idea. The mentality that even the tiniest action is worthwhile and those actions compounds into big results.

It is this mindset that can motivate you to do _something_ to move you into the right direction whatever that may be.

Simply putting down the tv remote can be considered its own action, putting on your running clothes, stepping out of your front door, take one step, then two steps then a walk, then a jog, then you'll be running before you know it &#x1f3c3;.

## Summary &#x1f4dd;

This mindset resonates with [how I build my habits](/how-i-build-habits).

Instead of looking at the end result and being put off by it, just focus on  he smallest step first, you'll find that even doing that is still progress, and you're able to do this consistently, you'll be surprised how productive you can be.

Remember the key take away:

**Make any task more approachable and apply a marginal adjustment to your routine.** &#x1f4aa; &#x1f4aa;
