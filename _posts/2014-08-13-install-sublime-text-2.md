The fastest way I've found to install sublime text 2.

<!--more-->

Copy and paste the following into the terminal
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text
</pre>

After running this, Sublime Text 2 should have been installed within the /usr/lib/sublime-text-2 directory and can be launched from the Dashboard
Alternatively by typing <strong>subl</strong>, <strong>sublime-text</strong> or <strong>sublime-text-2</strong> into a Terminal window.
