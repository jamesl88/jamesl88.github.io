I'm a software developer with 7+ years of commercial experience. I am familiar with the SOLID principles, OOP, MVC, ORM, API development, relational database design and RESTful conventions.

## Interests &#x1f3ae;

###### &#x1f4bb; Programming

I enjoy solving programming problems in C#. [Here is a repository of some examples](https://github.com/jameslieu/csharp_projects).

I also enjoy and participate on some programming communities on Slack, primarily the Makers Alumni channel where graduates from Makers (formally known as Makers Academy) join at the end of the course to discuss various topics, ask career related questions and share experiences working in the industry.

###### &#x1f4dd; Blogging
I write in this blog from time to time, occasionally about programming related topics.

###### &#x1f4da; Reading
I enjoy reading when I find time. My favourite genres:
- &#x2694; High fantasy
- &#x1f9d8; Personal Development
- &#x1f4c8; Productivity
- &#x1f4bb; Programming

See my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/jameslieu) to see which books I've read and recommend.

I also regularly read programming articles on sites such as:
- [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/)

###### &#x1f579; Gaming

When I find the time, I try to spend some of it playing video games. I usually game on PC and I'm currently playing:

- &#x1f3f9; Divinity Original Sin
